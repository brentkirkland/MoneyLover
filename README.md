# MoneyLover

**Warning: Build is not passing**

I suck at keeping track of my money... and I don't like my bank. So I decided to make a native app that will help me more easily keep track of my spending and amount of money left in my account. 

#Plaid

I'm current using Plaid to login to my bank account. I liked the look of their website and they have a nice free tier. Also Robinhood uses them so why not...

#Todo:
* Update README as more commits go by
* Make basic login for BofA to start
* Login error handling
* BofA questions
* More banks (sorry but my bank is BofA)
* Push notifications if I overdraft
* Continue hacking
* Make it cool
* Make it pretty

### Hate your bank too?
Well I'd love help, if you want to help. Or if you simply want to play with React-Native
