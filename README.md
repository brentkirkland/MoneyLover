# MoneyLover

I suck at keeping track of my money... and I don't like my bank. So I decided to make a native app that will help me more easily keep track of my spending and amount of money left in my account. 

#ToDo:
* Update README as more commits go by
* Make basic login for BofA to start
* Continue hacking
* Make it cool
* Make it pretty

### Hate your bank too?
Well I'd love help, if you want to help. Or if you simply want to play with React-Native
