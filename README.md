# react-native-plaid

This is a React Native app built with a Flux architecture and the Plaid API. This is essentially a boilerplate app that demonstrates the Flux architecture while making http request. Not only it gives a starting point in building an app with Plaid.

##React native

React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about - learn once, write anywhere. Facebook uses React Native in multiple production apps and will continue investing in React Native.

##Plaid

Plaid allows you to easily fetch banking data by allowing users to login with their bank accounts. 

##Future Ideas:
* Make the NavBar seperator white (so annoying)
* Build out the mfa questions and work more with the Plaid sandbox.
* Stylize
