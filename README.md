# MoneyLover


I suck at keeping track of my money... and I don't like my bank. So I decided to make a native app that will help me more easily keep track of my spending and amount of money left in my account.

##React native

React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about - learn once, write anywhere. Facebook uses React Native in multiple production apps and will continue investing in React Native.

##Plaid

I'm current using Plaid to login to my bank account. I liked the look of their website and they have a nice free tier. Also Robinhood uses them so why not... Currently I'm using their sandbox. I found testing your account makes the bank pissed. 

##Todo:
* Update README as more commits go by
* Make basic login for BofA to start
* Login error handling
* BofA questions
* More banks (sorry but my bank is BofA)
* Push notifications if I overdraft
* Continue hacking
* Make it cool
* Make it pretty

### Hate your bank too?
Well I'd love help, if you want to help. Or if you simply want to play with React-Native
